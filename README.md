# 🎛️ SampleMind AI – v3.4  
**Next-gen AI-powered sample management, reinvented for creators.**

SampleMind AI is a blazing-fast, intelligent, and modular toolkit for audio producers.  
Built for FL Studio and all major DAWs, it uses **Hermes-2 Pro**, **TensorFlow**, **librosa**, and **GPT-style** models to **analyze, tag, sort, curate, repair, and export** your audio content — from samples and loops to stems and soundscapes.

> ✨ Built with performance, automation, and creativity at the core. Designed to scale with your music.

## 🧑‍💻 About the Creator – @superman247

Hi, I’m **Lars Christian Tangen**, a passionate builder and audio engineer based in **Sandvika, Norway**. I specialize in AI-enhanced development, Python architecture, and music production tooling.  
My focus: **creating tools that fuse logic, automation, and sound** into seamless workflows that inspire creativity.

I'm currently the solo architect of **SampleMind AI**, but looking to collaborate with passionate creatives and devs to take it to the next level 🚀

## 🧪 Development Notes

- Configuration is unified in `utils/config.py`  
- All CLI tools are self-contained and interactive (with Finder support on macOS)  
- Audio tools rely on `librosa`, `essentia`, and `simpleaudio`  
- AI modules fall back safely and log all analysis and decisions  
- Tests validate live runs using real `.wav`, `.flac`, `.mp3`, and `.aiff` files
